"""Draft seed manifests for SAAF's reviewed agents from the portal's own data.

Source: public/data/agent-reviews.json in SAAF-Project/saaf-portal (public repo),
the registry the portal uses for the agent-library "reviewed" badge.

For every record with verdict "reviewed" this writes
    manifests/SAAF-Project__<repo>.yaml
and adds the repo to repos.txt. Existing manifests are left alone, so hand-written
ones (such as UC-8's, which has a full mandate) are never overwritten.

The drafts carry the map fields only. They have no mandate block on purpose: no
SAAF agent has published one yet, so the map shows them as "mandate issues" until
the agent's owners add one. That gap is the honest state of things.

Usage:
    python scripts/seed_from_portal.py                       # fetch from GitHub
    python scripts/seed_from_portal.py --reviews path.json   # use a local copy
